[[calauth]]
=== calauth
Provides the main authenticated public calendar web application for bedework.

This can be used to provide an internal view of calendar information. The only source difference is the web.xml to require authentication and change the app name and the jboss-web-xml to set the context.

This ought to be changed to copy source from the unauthenticated app.
